# What's For Dinner?

Live site: https://fordinner.netlify.app/

This is our submission for the Coder Academy Hackathon. The requirements were to build a web app using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. JavaScript frameworks were not allowed and a 3rd party API must be used.

## What is our submission?

A web app that fetches a random recipe based on cuisine and dietary requirements.

## Who is it for?

Anyone one who finds themselves stuck in the paradox of choice.
Sometimes deciding what's for dinner is just plain hard, especially after a long day.
This app is for anyone who'd rather just leave it up to the universe.

## Features

- Choose from 11 diets if applicable
- Choose from 26 cuisines (or don't for a surprise)
- Randomly generate a recipe
- If a combination of your preffered cuisine and dietary requirements doesn't exist, you'll get back another dish that matches your diet but from a different cuisine

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Custom CSS
- HTML
- Deployed on Netlify
- Spoonacular API
